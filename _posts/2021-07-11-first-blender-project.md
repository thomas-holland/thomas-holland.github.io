The classic doughnut project!

Here is the final result:

![final_doughnut_render](https://github.com/thomas-holland/thomas-holland.github.io/blob/main/assets/renders/doughnut/render_08.png?raw=true){:.ioda}

The first model I made was when I was first learning about the object edit mode as well as the sculpt mode. I made a few minor tweaks later down the line but the majority of the model did not change from this first render:

In this second render, everything is looking a bit plasticy but I was just getting the base texture as a colour done. It was also at this point that I experimented with the subsurface light properties (a material property the adjusts how light behaves within an object). I also made the plane that was acting as the floor very reflective and metalic, and positioned the light in a way for an interesting reflection that I ended up scrapping but at the time looked quite good.

At this point I did two main additions. The first is the most obvious, I added in the sprinkles! At this point I made them just blue, while experimenting with the size and shape. The other thing I added was a post processing effect on the image. The effect was a denoiser and made the image more crisp and less noisy. However, it made the doughnut look really plasticy so I had to change that later.

At this point I was finished adding content to the doughnut so I took a break from it and added in some fluorescent light bars (just cylinders with the emission ramped up). I also added a post processing effect to make a bloom effect, which make it look more realistic.

And back to the final image! At this point I made a few finishing touches to my first project. I decided to remove the overhead lamp as I really liked the side lit doughnut and the transmission to the center that came through as a result. I also added a platter under the doughnut so it wasnt sitting on the floor. The final change that I made was to the doughnut itself. I added a texture normal to the material, making it look more realistic and adding a few shadows to the pastry.

I decided to call it a day at this point (this took about 10 hours, so not too bad for a first blender project) and I am very pleased with the final result. If I was to change one thing, I would make the sprinkle size larger (I lost this when I had to restart some of the work - note to self to always save) and maybe play with the camera angle to get more of the pastry of the doughnut in frame.

Now moving onto a glass mug of something for my next project!
